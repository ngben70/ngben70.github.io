    <div>Audioslave was an <span>American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001.  </span>The four-piece band consisted of Chris Cornell, Soundgarden's lead singer and rhythm guitarist (pictured), and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass and backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Their sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock, using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. The group released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba.</div>
